### Express/React/Socket.io Boilerplate 

=== 

This is just a quick boilerplate I made to get socket.io working with my React setup. Because I needed my own server for Socket, I used the webpack-dev-middleware and webpack-hot-middleware for hot reloading and use of the webpack dev server. 

Enjoy!
